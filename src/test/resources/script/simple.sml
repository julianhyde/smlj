"a string";
true;
[1,2,3];
(1,2);
(1,(2,"three"),true);
[(1,"a"),(2,"b"),(3,"c")];
([1,2],["a","b","c"]);

(*) Simple commands
val x = 1;
x + 2;
let
  fun fact n =
    if n = 0
    then 1
    else n * (fact (n - 1))
in
  fact 5
end;
let
  fun sum x y = x + y
in
  sum 2
end;
it 3;

(* Disabled due to bug linking recursive functions at top-level
fun str s 0 l = l
  | str s i l = str ("a" ^ s) (i - 1) (s :: l);
val str = fn : string -> int -> string list -> string list

str "" 10 [];
val it =
  ["aaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaa","aaaaaaa","aaaaaa","aaaaa","aaaa","aaa","aa","a",""]
  : string list

(*) Note how long lists are wrapped and abbreviated
str "" 20 [];
val it =
  ["aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
   "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaa",
   "aaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaa",...]
  : string list
*)

(*) Bug: Fails due to lack of parentheses
(*
let
  fun in_ e [] = false
    | in_ e (h :: t) = e = h orelse in_ e t
in
  (in_ 3 [1,2,3], in_ 4 [1,2,3])
end;
*)

(*) Succeeds when parentheses are added
let
  fun in_ e [] = false
    | in_ e (h :: t) = e = h orelse (in_ e t)
in
  (in_ 3 [1,2,3], in_ 4 [1,2,3])
end;

(*) Multiple functions
let
  fun f x = 1
  fun g x = 2
in
  f (g 0)
end;

(*) Define a function using a higher-order functions
val longest = List_foldl (fn (s, t) => if String_size s > String_size t then s else t) "";
longest ["ab", "cde", "", "f"];
longest [];
